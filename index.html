          <div class="right"> The Uga mascots started in 1956 when Seiler brought a bulldog that was given to him as a wedding present by Frank Heard to Georgia's first home game of the season. Afterwards, head coach Wally Butts asked his permission to use the dog as Georgia's mascot, and around the same time a University of Georgia Law School fellow student and friend, Billy Young, suggested that he name it Uga, a play on the common abbreviation of the University of Georgia, UGA. Since then, every official Uga has been owned by and lived with the Seiler family in Savannah, Georgia. Even to this day, Uga is owned by the Seiler family, who take care of him when he isn't acting as the mascot on the field. They also transport him to and from the events he attends as mascot.</div>
